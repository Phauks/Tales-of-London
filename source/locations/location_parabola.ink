The Adulterine Castle # CLASS: location
When you remove space and time, soul and mind, power and reality; this is what remains.
You are surrounded by nothing. You don't see a serene castle, towering over infinity.
You do not meet the Stewards, who walk empty halls.
You are alone; no one walks besides you.
