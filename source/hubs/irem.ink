    Irem, The Pillared City # CLASS: location
    You gaze up Irem, the Pillared City. <>
    *   She will rise from the zee[...] and the ice like dawn. She will be garlanded with red and decked with gold. The Seven-Serpent will watch you longingly from its high pedestal. You will always arrive as a stranger, but when you leave, some part of you will always remain.
    Riddlefishers will greet you upon those stony docks; boots clacking upon the Sphinxstone blocks.
    You will lay your head at the House of the Amber Sky; and dream bitter-sweet dreams of forgotten tomorrows and inevitable yesterdays.
    -
    *   You will know where to go. You have always known.
    You find yourself before the Seven-Serpent. Resplendent, Imposing, Spectacular, Luminous. The Hydra of Irem. Adversary of Iolaus and Ninurta. Shadow of Mushmahhu and Bashmu.
    These are lesser names to lesser beings. The stars may wink out, the world may breath its last breath, and yet they shall remain. For they always wait for thee.
    -
    *   The Seven-Serpent will coil atop its pedestal[]. Its ruby eyes will reflect the future. Fate's thread will dangle from its jaws like a mouse's tail â€“ and you will seize it.
    You stand before the Loom of Fate. Weft and Warp, threads of Destiny spreading across your fingertips.
    -
    *   All that remains[...] is to act.
    You gaze upon a kaleidoscope of thread; multitudes of pasts overlapping with potentialities of futures.
    -
    *   You must find you find yourself.[] You must find your past. 
    Who are you?
    How did you get here?
    What future will be so great to be worth the price it took to arrive?
    Ponder.
    Weave.

You blink. Your lodgings surround you.
You blink. Colour begins to seep.
Memory impeading upon Reality. Reality impeading upon Truth.
You blink.
London fades away.
Irrigo swirls with Violant, Cosmogone battles with Peligin, Apocyan and Viric share tea, Gant swallows all.
A kaleidoscope of colours cascades until a new Reality is formed.

Thank you for playing the Tales of London - The Loom of Fate!
If you are seeing this, that means that you have decided to take a future from the Loom of Fate.
There is a lot of content that went into making this game, and I didn't want to half-ass the endings. I think they could be especially interesting if a Quirk system was also built into it to enable more variety over choices.
I will come back to Endings after more of the game as been ironed out.
But I am incredibly thankful you made it this far!
If you want to help out in any capacity reach out to any of the creators of this game. We are always looking for more help and inspiration. 
Maybe take a crack at making your own Exceptional Tale!
