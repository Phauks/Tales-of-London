What comes after life? You would think death, that final and resolute evil. And yet, those who die here in the Neath don't often stay that way.
What principles exist here that don't exist on the surface that enables this phenomenon? Where do the living find themselves, at the nexus of life and death?
Or rather...what laws are broken. And if these Laws are being broken, then who stands in Judgement against these crimes?

Sometimes when one takes a journey and finds themselves engrossed in a good book, they find that they arrive much faster at their destination. The inverse is also true. A terribly dreadful book will make the journey as unbearable as a sermon from St. Dustins. And yet; sometimes, regardless of the book, the destinations distance varies.
Some places will never open to you, until they are ready. Others are just a step out from your lodgings.

On the surface, under the brilliant light of day, one is constantly reminded that the body is weak, frail, and fragile. Injuries lead onto death and dismemberment. One�s body is a vessel, one that repairs slowly, if at all, under the conventional laws of being.
And yet, in this dark and dreary wonderland, one�s body is mutable. It can be morphed, shifted, shaped, changed to ones liking with practice and practical application.
What law, and imposed by whom, is so righteous to deny all living beings the right to become their best self.
Is it a mercy? Or a fear, that some greater power has...that one day, those beneath them will steal their crowns?

Places are never where they should be. Sometimes, it takes but a five-minute walk to arrive at your destination from your point of origin. Other times, you might always be in sight, but never in reach of your goals.
Yesterday, the bakery was only three blocks away; today, you had to walk through all the boroughs of London to get there; only to find that they had just sold their last loaf of bread.
Zee Islands act in a similar manner. There are certain rules they seem to follow as if programmed into random arrangements. Understanding these rules takes much effort; but in time, you begin to predict with increasing accuracy your goals. It isn't about where something should be; but rather, where something will be.
And when you finally understand this deep enough; you are able to reach the places that were deemed forbidden, untrodden, and sacred.
In one such dark place, far from where you should be, but exactly where you needed to be; you will find yourself in the void. And that emptiness will speak.
And you will know you are in the Realm of the Gods.

There are several types of monsters. There are the lesser kind, which while unpleasant, can often be fought against. There are the greater kind, which when faced, often requires a swift flight or fight response. This greater kind is not unbeatable, but something to be faced with proper preparations.
Then, there are the monsters that even hell itself would spit back out.
Down beneath the Singing Mandrake you can hear it. The thrumming, humming, thumping masses. Sorrow-Spiders entwining to become Spider-Councils. The former being the lesser kind of monster, the latter being the greater.
But when Spider-Councils entwine their spires, they can become something truly fearsome.

Truthfully, this isn't how you thought you would spend your day. But your neighbor Mrs. P____ has been so bloody loud each night! She came to you, with blood-shot eyes and a sleep-deprived face, begging, begging for aid.
You called in a favor, and a Silverer aided you in passage to this part of Parabola. It is dark, and vicious, unlike some of the more pleasant wilds of the land of Dreams. You spot Mrs. P_____, and follow her deeper.
Something stalks her, in the dark. It hungers, and gnaws at her shadow.
You stand between the vagrant and the lady. You draw out your blade, wailing with hunger, and attack.
When the fighting is over, all that remains of the beast is the hollow corpse of a man. Mrs. P_____ rises from the bushes, and meanders towards the glade. She falls before the corpse, and cries.
Love is complicated. She loved him, but he not her. His memory, of what was, and what could have been, stalk her like a silent shadow.
This will not be the last time she finds herself here. Nor will it be the last time she must run from her past.
But hopefully, in time, she will find the strength to dominate over her demons.

You heard rumors of a Bound Shark sinking trading vessels between the Salt Lions and Hunter's Keep. You would have filed away those inevitable tragedies in the dark recesses of your mind had the reward for its death not been worthy of your consideration.
You circle around the Salt Lions for three days and three nights. Upon the rise of the fourth day, you finally spot your prey.
It swims, although it might be more apt to describe that the waters part before away from a monstrosity.
One of your crew remarks that you will need a bigger boat.
However, you only smirk. It isn't only might that will end a foe; but also, knowledge of your enemy.
It will take another day for you to vanquish the beast; and when the light from its eyes finally blinks out, you will tie the Bound Sharkk to your boat; and head to port.

The Boatman is cold, with a maniacal grin of which there is no escape. There is no ritual, no exchange that must be made before beginning a game with him. As one might expect, ferrying passengers for unknown eons makes one very open to distraction. It just so happens that his passengers aren't often in the mood for such frivolities.
You sit before the Boatman, and play. Time passes, your wounds heal. Passengers come and go. Many look to the Far Shore with fear; few decide to stay long on your pleasure cruise.
After multitudes of games, numerous wins, and countless loses; you finally find yourself precariously balanced. Your victories, the Boatmans, and one final game, tied to the Stalemate.

The only person you haven't accepted into the ranks is the Viscountess because you are still extremely angry with when she almost destroyed London a few Estivals ago. And she still won't tell you what it was all for!

There is a war in London. A war between the material and immaterial; between the real and the unreal; between that which Is and that which Is-Not.
This conflict, which sprung from beyond the veil of our reality, is a fight for existence.
Those beings which were born into non-existence on the other side of the mirror are most well known as the Fingerkings, malleable, snake-like tricksters, are fighting for the right to exist.
They are opposed by individuals who would which to stand in the way of their non-birthright.
The opposition might go by any number of names, the Cats, the Tigers, the Shroud. But they all share the same goal: to stand as the bulwark against these invaders from beyond the mortal realm.

You will stare, deep, until naught but Cosmogone sears your eyelids. And when you close your eyes, you will see it. A true impossibility. An unknowable truth. Something that can never escape this land.
And you will pull, you will grasp impossibility with the impossibility of impossibility. For all things can be. The very nature of this place acting against such an absolute truth.
You will drag this thing, this dreadful thing, from its cradle. Through the forests, past the chessboards, through dreams and nightmares, until you stand before a great mirror.

History no longer Is, as it Was. And if something Was, it Is-Not, at least, not anymore.
From the border of reality and irreality, you will learn the border of truth and acceptance. One does not need to accept the truth to live a good life. One can accept a lie for every day of their life and be none the wiser. In fact, this makes many people happier. Oh how simple life is when one accepts a convenient truth.
You dip your cloak in the Wellspring of Moulin. It glows Viric, and imbues itself with the waters. When you pull the cloak out of those glowing depths it will have changed. Yes, of course, it is still your cloak. But truth is relative isn't is? Now, it has become something greater, as have you.

Rubbery Men are strange. That should be said without saying anything. One must only take a glance at the tentacley nature of their...well, everything. They are mucousy and impossible to understand, almost alien in nature. And yet, they still understand acts of kindness and anger. As distant as they are from us, they still share some tangible similarities with 'man'.
Work from these tangibilitys; understand the similarities that connect all living things. Then, you can focus on the differences.

The Starved Embassy is a somewhat sorry affair. You bring a gift; the delegates exchange it for one of their own. The whole point is to increase the interaction between common folks and these foreign powers, but you wish there was more interaction besides the fact.
You voice your concerns to one of the Starved Men, and he rightly agrees.
After the main event ends, you and several other Starved Men do a drinking tour around London on the premise of "spreading faith to Londoners that we can all get along". A swimming idea because it lets you charge the extravagant party to the Embassys bill.
The night is a cacophony of drinking, dancing, fighting, and raucous laughter. When you awaken the next day, you have a noxious headache; while the Starved Men you partied with seem absolutely fine. One attributes it to simply changing themselves enough that they don't feel the aftereffects of alcohol.
Lucky buggers. Perhaps after some coffee and once you are feeling more like yourself, you shall consider the benefits of learning such an art.

When the Starved Men attacked London, London answered by creating their own fleet of airships to bring the fight back to them. Although the conflict has since ended, airships have been making more frequent visits to the Roof.
You board one of these ships, often used for transporting the various delegations of Starved Men from their home on the Roof to London.
If the Starved Men have an embassy in London, it seems only fair that London has an embassy up there as well?
You shall spend some time above London. The light of the False-Stars will be so much brighter from up close, and you will embrace the teachings.

You will go where the rumors lead you...
Down, into the depths beneath the Carnival.
Down, through bedrock and sandstone.
Down, where little light shines.
Until you find yourself in the hidden refuge of the Rubbery Men.
You will morph your body, and they will accept you as friend.
Perhaps you find love with one handsome specimen; and perhaps they love you in return.
The residents of this cool and dark place will share their amber with you, and you will share your body with them.
When you finally leave; you are not as you were.

Those who reside in Godfall only really care about three things. Brawling, Drinking, and the amalgamous nature of their body. They fight each other, they drink, and they slowly morph their bodies into new shapes.
They accept you into their ranks and provide you a new name. You take the oaths, and the alms. You pray, and learn, and break a few arms in the brawls. But when one�s body is as malleable as ones beliefs; such injuries hardly matter.
The monks will continue to accept you in the future; even as you sail away. Loyalty and oaths are malleable as well; and this is one of the most important things they wish to teach you.

You have learnt much about amalgomy. About the morphing of mind, of body, of ideals, of dreams, of oaths. Now, you seek the oldest teacher of them all. Those who didn't have to learn these principles, but inherently understood them in the core of their beings. You seek the Lorn-Flukes.
You sail your ship towards the Elder Continent and begin to morph your ideals. Your body shifts under these changes. You make and break promises to yourself; you grow larger, and smaller; you craft wonderful dreams of your future, and then scuttle them with further dreams of their destruction.
In short, you enumerate all the qualities of a Lorn-Fluke. And like a magnet to metal, or a moth to a flame, they arise from the depth.
Seven Lorn-Flukes circle your ship. Barring egress or ingress from this holy ritual. The largest approaches you, rolling on its barbs and spikes; until a single eye looks beadily upon you.
It presents seven spines; and from each spine, you pierce your hand. Visions of pasts, visions of futures, visions of things lost.
The Lorn-Flukes accept you into their own; and deposits a smaller Lorn-Fluke on your ship. Then, they sink back into the depths.
The new small Lorn-Fluke doesn't move; doesn't breathe; doesn't morph. After careful observation, you discover that it was not long for this world.
From inside, you spy a glowing irrigo mass. It will take many hours of careful extraction to remove it.

You would think that a museum would be a safe place to learn about the world. That is what you assumed at least, when you deemed to enter the exhibit on poisonous frogs, toads, and other slimy beasts. Yet some snotty-nosed brat with a lightning bolt scar decided to make the glass disappear between all the exhibits!
You try to avoid the more dangerous looking animals that get lose. The wild-toed bullfrog and the lemurian snake. You can't avoid them all of course, they really are all over the place, but eventually you escape from the horrendous exhibit and seek medical treatment.
Although you did need a few medicines and ointments to heal your wounds, you recover swiftly enough. However, a thought begins to nag you incessantly.
Careful application of small doses of poison can increase your immunity to said poisons. Perhaps this is a line of inquiry that should be considered further.

You begin your testing of poison not on yourself, but on others (naturally, why would you subject yourself to such dangerous experimentation). Besides, all players of Heart's Game are 'willing participants'!
You slowly poison one adversary after the next. The reactions are variable, and yet illuminating. Some participants succumb much faster to your methods than others, but as the bodies fall, your knowledge rises.
Oh, how scientific progress would be much expedited if similar methods of experimentation weren't deemed unfit by the University!

It takes many dreams to finally gather enough Attar for your goal. From your waist you pull 77 candles. On the floor of the Arborian Treasury you place the candles in seven concentric circles. The circles, written in Attar, with rings around each Foxfire Candles, produce a crimson glow as the candles flicker and wave with each passing second. Sixty, Seventy, Seventy-Five.
You light the penultimate candle, those who call Arbor home have long since fled and granted you the privacy deemed sacred for this sacrament. 
You light the final candle, and the circle is complete. It wavers, and flickers, like a memory of a dream.
The Roseatte Queen stands before you, resplendent in her glory, terrible in her beauty. She gazes upon you, and you truly understand for the first time what a Regal Presence truly means.
"My child... there are easier ways to garner my attention. Such...sacrilegious methods are somewhat unnecessary. But you have performed the rights, and as such I will act as promised in the ancient accord."
From her shifting robes she produces a vial, no larger than a thimble, and hands it to you. It doesn't glow in the traditional sense, but you feel a throbbing power from within.
You look upon the face of the Queen, but she stands impassive. What she has given you is a part of herself, and from this, much can be learned, and much destroyed.
Perhaps she hopes for that destruction or believes in your magnanimity.
Time in Arbor is always memorable.

There is a secret within the Palace. One would be remiss to learn that the fall of London was anything but happenstance. No...there was an exchange. The monkeys� paw was used to great a great power a wish, and now, this is what remains.
You sneak past the servants and butlers, past the paintings of beloved Queens and lovestruck Kings, into the Palace Cellars.
There is something down here. Something horrible. Something powerful.
It will take delicate precision and careful application of your skills, but you shall approach the Cantigaster. The Cantigaster will survey you, but do nothing. You will take the vial, and place it to his eyes, and his tears will flow into it. Carefully you stopper the dewy fluids, the venom of the Cantigasters heart.

One cannot be expected to experiment wholly on their own body. Especially when it involves subjecting one�s body to toxins and toxicity experimentations. Better to leave that to the industrial workers. Let them blame bad working conditions rather than your own machinations.
You provide food, meals, and alms to the poor workers who live in the slums of the Factory. No one ever really gets sick from your work, in fact, some become more rejuvenated from your efforts.
You act as a vampire in these parts. You learn, you adapt, you take what you need; you're not any worse than the overlords of the factory at least!

You are enjoying a picnic on the water�s edge, when three Drownies approach you from the water.
They try to convince you to join them, "You shall be welcome here," says the first. "You will feel no pain," says the second. "All shall be well," says the third. But their honeyed words and sweet songs have long since lost their efficacy on you.
You invite them to dine with you. Being a monster can be terribly lonely. They readily accept your invitation, quickly descend into the depths before returning for victuals of their own.
You dine, with the Drownies, and swap secrets and sorrows only the exiled can appreciate. You dine of their food; and they of yours.
Poison and Medicine are often so similar; just taken in the different quantities. Just as the only line that delineates horrors and wonders is the perspective of the individuals.
The Drownies leave you; and you are alone on the beach once again.
They have left behind small gifts, hearts of beasts, sea grasses from the great deep, a written letter of appreciation. It will take several False-Moons; but you believe in your ability to extract the true value of these gifts in Station VIII.
You gaze back upon the water and sigh, "Aren't we all adrift on a Sea of Misery?"

You begin the ascent of the Mourn. Already many meters above the waters lapping tongue. Higher and higher you climb, the shipwrecked cove of piracy and malice slipping beneath you.
Past an Urchin, passing the time with Parrots. Past the last shrub and tree and greenery; until you stand atop the highest peak, on a stone that only barely holds your boot.
From these great heights it would be so easy to fall; but you level your gaze upon the horizon. From here, the Roof seems so close. From here, you can make out many islands, and many kingdoms. Untamed, unrulable. You see ships under attack; and ships scuttling rocky terrain.
You gaze south, towards the blinding light of the Mountain of Light. North, towards untouchable lands. West, towards the welcoming docks of London. And East; beyond which no man returns.
Although the islands always seem to move, and distances seem volatile, you feel confident that the waves will yield to you easier than before.

Perhaps you made a mistake. You fought one too many Crabs or couldn't outrun your pursuer. Perhaps your ship simply ran out a supplies, and you lost the lot.
In any case, you find yourself in a very cold place. You are escorted down a barnacled covered hall, and two great glowing doors open before you.
The Fathom-King sits before you; a bored look in his eyes.
You are not the first in his presence today; and most likely, you will not be the last. He bids you speak your piece; what you have learnt, what you can offer. Perhaps, if he likes what he hears, you will not face death, or a fate worse than that.
You speak of your actions in London, your trade routes across the Zee. You speak of the lands you have seen and the individuals of little and great importance that you have met.
His eyes raise with slight interest. You are not the most important nor most interesting individual he has met; but you have enough to pique his interest.
He sends you on your way...as nicely as he can, to the Boatman.

You make your plans in private; for any who knew the truth in public would decry you a fool. But you aren't planning for a long journey, just a short jaunt to the event horizon.
You will zail from the Khanate, and head East.
You will make no progress, you will pass by the same land�s multiple times, and for many moons your actions will remain unfathomable.
Then, as your rations begin to yield, and mutinous murmurs begin to ruminate, the tides will change.
You will feel your craft pulled East, closer to an unfathomable existence.
You will turn the ship back, skirting the point of no return.
You will gaze East, and what you see will be of terrible beauty, and unknowable sorrow. Sorrow that you may never approach that fabled horizon, or sorrow that such unfathomable horror awaits you; no member of your crew will dare ask.
When you return, you will find yourself surrounded by unknown islands. Your charts will be useless.
You stop at an island, uninhabited except for a small hamlet home to a Great Devil. He will offer no aid, nor hinder your excursion on the island. You resupply your diminished supplies, and once again take up the search back to London.
