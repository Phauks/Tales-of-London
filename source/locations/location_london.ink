A Slow Boat Trip # CLASS: location
You made a terrible mistake. Maybe you wronged the wrong foe, or slipped on the wet cobblestones, or simply forgot to tend to your wounds. Now you find yourself in a place of Death.
Placid black water. Barren trees. A boat filled with pale and shivering passengers. Across the calm waters is must be the place of the dead, over there on the far bank. Maybe stay clear of it?

= blind_helmsman
The Blind Helmsman # CLASS: location
Zailors find relaxation here; where the drinks are cold and they can finally take off their barnacle-toed boots. You see a Black Ribbon Duelist, or, what remains of one. Awful business, isn't it? The backrooms are right for the gamblers of all ilk’s.
Rats scamper around the basement

The Bone Market # CLASS: location
For those in the know, the Department of Menace Eradication has secretive backroom. Maybe you heard about it from your University friends. Or maybe you attended a party and noticed an outrageous skeletal display.
Buying, selling, trading. For those who can gather legitimate materials, and even so for illegitimate ones, this can be a place of great wealth.

Cave of Nadir # CLASS: location
You come to a place that no one will know. That you will soon forget. Is this your first time? Or have you been here before?
Listen to the voices. Do not go too deep into the miasma.
This place may be of great interest to higher powers.

The Department of Menace Eradication # CLASS: location
I guess you could say that London falling into the Neath helped with the rat problem, as now you can talk to the bloody menaces. But, on the other side, Londoners have much more to worry about now.

Disgraced Exile in the Tomb Colonies # CLASS: location
Egad! You said what?! To whom?! Maybe it was a blunder, or perhaps you used your anatomical knowledge to show someone  you shouldn't have where they can stick their opinions. Either way, you probably deserve to be here.
Few truly die in London. Most make their way over here to wither or become something truly different. Home to outcasts, the disgraced, the bored, the forgotten.
Enjoy your (probably temporary) stay in Venderbight!

The Empress' Court # CLASS: location
You enter the Court of Her Endearing Majesty, the Queen, high power of London. This is a place of machinations, subtlety, and particularly tasty meat pies.
You see a particularly bored fellow in a side-room working on a literary project. They seem quite bored with the monotony of the work. Truly, should art be so boring?

The Flit # CLASS: location
High in on the rooftops! As close to the sky as you can get in London unless you feel like scrambling like a monkey up the Spires of the Bazaar.
Enjoy breakfast-dinner with the Topsy King: the notorious beggar-king of the Flit. Although he's far from royalty, you should probably present yourself. Oh yes: he's supposed to be incomprehensibly insane.
Whittle your time with Fisher-Kings, Noughts, Crosses, Bats, Cats, and engage in all manner of Chicanery!

The Foreign Office # CLASS: location
London must protect her interests, and her interests are your interests! Engage with Agents of the Crown, and those who seek to influence the balance of power in the Neath.
Wear a smile on your face and hold a dagger behind your back. Or perhaps poison is more your forte? In this line of work, you really should pull out life-insurance.

The Forgotten Quarter # CLASS: location
They call London the Fifth City for a reason. Walk the avenues of a forgotten land, crushed under the footprint of London like workers under late-stage capitalism.
Few remain from this city. They have vanished or taken new names. Even less are still around from the cities before this one.
You see an image of a Silver Tree carved in a rock nearby.

The Labyrinth of Tigers # CLASS: location
How exciting! It's like Mrs. Plenty's Carnival, but more dangerous! Seven delicious coils of spiraling delights. Are you the prey, or the predator? Whom is viewing whom in the exhibits? What enigmatic secrets does the Tiger Keeper keep?

Ladybones Road # CLASS: location
A charming enough place. Home to the Brass Embassy and those who engage in the other goods and exchanges. For many of those who find themselves in London, this is the first place they visit as they try and learn the secrets of the city.
Truly a soulless place.

The Mirror Marches # CLASS: location
A Cosmogone sun hovers low in a real sky. Tangles of green foliage and the sounds of nature; little tickings and chirpings. Here and there, though, are man-made shapes and shiny surfaces; straight lines and right angles – empty frames.
You find yourself in a place of Dreams. A vast jungle of mirrors, snakes, temples. Glimpse shadows of what lies in the Is, for this is the Is-Not.
Perhaps you will find your way to the Royal Bethlehem Hotel?

New Newgate Prison # CLASS: location
This is a place of Birth. It is strange, isn't it...to think of a prison as a place of creation? But it's true. This is where it begins, for all of us.
A prison in the roof of the Neath. Truly I'm surprised that the Starved Men have never attacked this place. Well... they are known for their malleable opinions.

The Roof # CLASS: location
The only comparable view would be from New Newgate Prison, and let’s be honest, it is much more pleasurable to look on the Neath 'not' from behind metal bars. The city is smaller, from here, like a beating heart. Lights glow and permeate through the darkness. To the Zee, to Hell, from here, one can view a fraction of the Neath, and appreciate(or realize the cosmic horror) of how small we all are.

Fallen London's two colleges, Benthic and Summerset, enjoy a healthy rivalry. They play team sports with each other. They play pranks on each other. On certain days of the year, they play trumpets and French horns at each other." (Like the Oxford-Cambridge boat race. But with trumpets.)
Play games of Badminton, battle in games of the mind. Perhaps someone will be up for a game of Cricket?
