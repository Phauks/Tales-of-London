Six was an unlucky number. But it is not The Number.

Your Menorah won't be big enough for the remaining candles.

In the quiet room, shadows danced eerily in the candlelight, whispering secrets few could comprehend.

{player_smen == 9:
A singular direction becomes a fixation, a magnetic pull drawing the thoughts into a chaotic dance, spiraling into a maze of confusion. North.
    -> smen_egress
    }
{player_smen == 10:
Candles flickered in the dimly lit space, casting elongated shadows that seemed to morph into grotesque figures, dancing in rhythm with your fraying sanity.
    -> smen_egress
    }
{player_smen == 11:
It Burns, a mantra muttered under breath, an incantation that echoed through the labyrinth of the mind, each repetition intensifying the flames within.
    -> smen_egress
    }
{player_smen == 12:
The Name, an elusive enigma, whispered through the corridors of madness, a tantalizing riddle that begged to be unraveled, yet remained just out of reach.

{player_smen == 13:
Seven, an obsession that gripped the unraveling psyche, multiplying in significance with each passing moment, an anchor in the storm of delirium.

A spectral figure emerged, draped in shadows, a manifestation of the madness that coiled like a serpent within the recesses of the mind.
    -> smen_egress

{player_smen == 15:
NORTH, a cardinal point that no longer adhered to the laws of geography, but instead, pointed to an intangible destination in the vast expanse of the irrational.
    -> smen_egress
    }
{player_smen == 16:
Candles multiplied, an army of flickering flames that danced in discordant harmony, casting a ghostly glow upon the descent into the abyss.
    -> smen_egress

{player_smen == 17:
Seven, a sacred number that resonated with cosmic significance, a beacon of order in the swirling chaos that threatened to engulf the fragile mind.
    -> smen_egress
    }
{player_smen == 18:
The room pulsated with an otherworldly energy, as if the very fabric of reality was unraveling, giving way to a surreal landscape where the laws of logic bowed to the whims of those above you in the Chain.
    -> smen_egress
    }
{player_smen == 19:
The room became a carnival of illusions, with reality and fantasy intertwining in a macabre dance, and the boundaries between sanity and insanity melting away.

{player_smen == 20:
A single truth reveals itself in your mind: A Reckoning Cannot Be Postponed Indefinitely.

Are you any closer to your goal? Is madness and self-destruction worth it?

You have every right to ruin your own life - but do you have the right to change the fate of a whole Realm?

{player_smen == 23:
You see an vision, a hushed courtroom, the accused awaited with bated breath, knowing that the reckoning for their deeds was inevitable.

{player_smen == 24:
Perhaps you are in the mood for some Chestnuts?
    -> smen_egress

{player_smen == 25:
The hunger, a primal force, lurked in the shadows of the forgotten city, consuming the remnants of hope and leaving only the bitter taste of despair.
    -> smen_egress

{player_smen == 26:
The abyssal depths of the ocean concealed a hunger that transcended the physical, a relentless and treacherous yearning that sought to devour all in its path.

There are Gods, and there are Men. Does you have the right to Ascend?

Seven on Seven on Seven on Seven.

The Fingerkings, the Starved Men, the Shames. There are terrors in this land - but seemingly pale to the darkness of your soul.

{player_smen == 30:
Your neighbors check on you; but you shoo them away.

Along this path, your friends will betray you. And you will welcome it.

You blacken your mind like paper.

You drown your secrets in misery.

    }

It burns.

    }
{player_smen == 41:
You char yourself with Enigmas.

    }
{player_smen == 42:
You make a wild guess, and guess correctly.

{player_smen == 43:
You light a taper, and see truth through the fires.
    -> smen_egress

The Starveling Cat, The Starveling Cat! This was a bad idea, I tell you that.

{player_smen == 46:
You buy some Rubbery Lumps to sate your hunger. Then throw them away, you will not stray from this path.

= discordance_breath_void
This is the embodiment of the language betwixt stars, this is how is sounds, in the void. You open the container holding it and force it into your mouth. It happily enters, grateful to be released from its prison; only to find itself within your own body. The message is angry, the message is furious, it demands release.
Release it, let it exalt itself upon the world. Let it rise, like an scream stuck in your throat like a stone, until it can no longer be held within. And upon the inevitable jailbreak of the canary, it will wreck havoc upon its captor.
+ You are less than you were, and that means you are greater.

= discordance_masters_blood
You release the cork, and throw it in the Stolen River. The vial hums, a terrible song. You slowly pour the vial out, drip by drip, and it washes away in the sweeping currents. Then you toss the bottle against one of the pillars holding the bridge for good measure.
What you once held was the lifeblood of a being higher on the Chain then yourself. You forsook your chance to ascend the Chain with such an ingredient. For one simple truth.
You have no need of borrowed power. Power stolen, power given, power borrowed. These are things without value.
You have earned, and will continue to earn, the means to your own success.
And when you stand above the rest, upon your Ivory Throne, it will be with a power that will have no name but your own.

= discordance_reported_location
Oh what some people would give for such information. Wealth innumerable, power unimaginable. Luxury for the rest of your meager life.
And yet, such sweet victories shall not pass.
You make your way to the Cave of Nadir. You will pull the information from your head with Irrigo. You will hold it in the palm of your hand, and you will leave it deep within the Cave.
It will remain there, along with other forgotten memories. Is it a mercy, to the one it would hurt? Or a lesson, one that ironically you will forget?
In any case, when you emerge from the Cave, you feel a great sense of relief wash over yourself.
Perhaps you left more of yourself within than you realize.

= discordance_impossible_theorem
You hold your Impossible Theorem in your hand and remember all that it cost you to achieve. The hardships, the sacrifice, the fierce battles to wring this from Irreality.
And you let it go.
It looks upon you, gauging you, as if expecting this to be a test. Before morphing into a most impossible shape and imploding upon itself.
It was never meant to be, and because of that, it was beautiful.
You feel part of yourself leave with it.

= discordance_veils_velvet
You pull out a match, and light it upon the heel of your boot. The phosphorus glows red in the darkness. You hold the match close, closer, closer to the fabric, until the two are intertwined. The fabric shifts, as if it wants to run away. Then it bursts into flames.
You do not let go, you keep your iron clasp on the screaming fabric as it wriggles in agony. Your hand heats up, and blisters as the flames hungrily lick your cuffs.
Then the flames cease. All that remain is ashes. Ashes, and the waft of smoke.
+ You are less than you were, and that means you are greater.

= discordance_rumourmongers_network
Many men would give their life for such a prize. In fact, many have in an attempt to do so. This was a Network that could raise and topple kings; the connections forged took a lifetime to build, and its destruction also means the destruction of the trust you have built.
And all it takes is one pull to topple the house of cards.
It's fascinating how such a complex and interwoven machine can turn against itself, like the immune system fighting its own body.
You will watch, from atop the hill, as your forged identities are exposed as lies. You will listen, in the cafes, as players of the game find themselves with greater and greater advantages than they had before.
And when it ceases, when the rumors end, all shall be quiet.
+ You are less than you were, and that means you are greater.

= discordance_fluke_core
Condensed memory. The final remnants of a once great power. You accepted those that could change, and morph, and shape themselves into something greater. You beheld the Rubbery Men, and learned their histories. You partook of the wisdom of the Starved Men, and learnt that though the body is a prison; it is a prison of ones own making.
You hold the irrigo core in your hand; dense and pulsing; as dreams of Axile and higher planes seep into your mind.
You drop the core to the ground, raise your boot, and exalt Judgement upon the Fluke Core.
It shatters under your efforts, the winds of space seemingly pushing out from the point of destruction.
You feel terrible anger; not at you, but at the tragedy and loss of an irreturnable home.
You feel loss, and sadness. Memories overwhelm you like waves in a tempest.
You are surrounded by your peers, and then you are alone, hidden from those who would wish you harm.
The memories cease, but the imprint will remain.

= discordance_tasting_flight
What good is a tasting flight if you don't drink it!
You guzzle down the first and second vials, and feel your body scream in agony.
You take the third and fourth vials, each powerful enough to take down elephants and Zee Crabs respectively.
Your body screams, and condenses into itself.
You barely get the fifth down your gullet. A haze clouds your vision. Toxins that affect the mind, toxins that effect the body.
And yet you continue.
The Sixth. Pain, terrible. Indescribable.
And then Seventh.
And all is calm.
What madness possessed you to perform such horrendous rites, you have no idea.
But you feel yourself changed. You have killed off the weaker parts of yourself. And what remains...well, you are sure it is still mostly yourself.
+ You are less than you were, and that means you are greater.
