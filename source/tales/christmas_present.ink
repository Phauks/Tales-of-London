Coffee At Christmas # CLASS: event

- It is Christmas in the Neath. The streets are filled with snow. Urchins slide down Watchmaker Hill on handmade sleds. The Benthic and Summerset Colleges have put their feud on hold in the spirit of the festivities. There are even rumours of Masters making door to door visits.
    One snowy morning you have a most fabulous idea!
What is it that people want more than anything on dreary days such as these? It gets quite cold this time of year, and you are sure many people would love a nice cup of Darkdrop Coffee to warm their soul...or lack-thereof.
+   You make plans immmediately.
+   Oh come now, I am quite comfortable in my abode. Why should I make haste?
        Well, where there is opportunity, there is profit! Maybe you can use this opportunity to make some money, or strengthen connections, or out of the good-will of your heart?
        ++  Do it for Wealth!
                Nothing wrong with lining your pockets.
        ++  Do it to strengthen your Network.
                You'll be suprised what people let slip when they find the smallest bit of respite.
        ++  Do it out of the kindness of your Heart.
                Just think of the children!
        ++  Do it in aid of the Revolution!
                You make logical deductions and leaps of faith until you come to a most illogical conclusion of how selling Coffee will benefit the Liberation.
                
- Firstly, and maybe the most important business!
This venture must have a name.
    +   Snowbucks
            ~ coffee_name = "Snowbucks"
            The name reminds you of the Zee. Perhaps you'll get a Drownie to pose for the logo.
    +   Bazaar Brews & Beans
             ~ coffee_name = "Bazaar Brews & Beans"
             Perhaps invoking the Bazaar will garner you some respect.
    +   Echo Espresso Emporium
             ~ coffee_name = "Echo Espresso Emporium"
             Only an Echo a cup!
    +   Nadir Nectars & Coffees
             ~ coffee_name = "Nadir Nectars & Coffees"
            You'll forget you've had anything better.
    +   The Rubbery Roasts
             ~ coffee_name = "The Rubbery Roasts"
            Perfect to go with your Rubbery Lumps!
    +   Parabolan Percolations
             ~ coffee_name = "Parabolan Percolations"
             The stuff dreams are made of.
    +   The Boatman's Brew
             ~ coffee_name = "The Boatman's Brew"
             You doubt that Skeleton will complain in person, but perhaps be ready for a confrontation upon your next death.

        You find a stall selling the Darkdrop Coffee Beans, but at an absurd price! 30 Echoes for a single sack! You have other expenses to consider! And besides, you aren't even sure you will make a profit.
        The Opportunistic Rat races over from between bags of apples and barley.

                    Suddenly the Opportunistic Rat reappears, holding what appears to be his prize.
                    "Alright, alright, alright. Wasn't no problem not one bit. Just had my friend give this old hag a bite while I grabbed the goods. I could only grab one of the ones in the back though.
                    He hands over the bag, and scampers off.
                    You open the bag to inspect your prize. The beans are of a lower quality than you had hoped, but they will suffice. You close the bag, and maybe feel a little bad for the acquisition.

                    "Alright Govn'r! Follows me."
                    He leads you down a back-alley to an abandoned building and tells you to wait for a minute or two. He scampers in the wall, you here the skittering of paws and the tiny raspings of conversation, before the Opportunistic Rat and several other rats push a sack out a window.
                    You open the bag to find small, round, brown pellets of an unknown variety. They have the putrid smell similar to Darkdrop Coffee Beans.

in {coffee_venue}. Although many people have trodden into Parabola while dreaming; it is the stark majority that have never truly entered it through the mirror. You hired several Silverers to help bring the customers in...and to make sure that they don't wander off into the forests of dreams and nightmares beyond the security of your Base-Camp.
}
{coffee_venue == "Your Ship":
on {coffee_venue}. You have planned a most elegant pleasure cruise around the more safe shipping lanes of the Zee. You will serve biscuits, scones, and other delights to match the atmosphere of the various Zee Regions. Hot drinks will be served in the frigid North; spiced treats when approaching the Khanate, etc. A careful application of the Treacheries of Clocks and Maps will make the journey much more expedited than one might assume.

{coffee_advertisement == "A Most Impressive Ad Campaign Across All of London":
{coffee_advertisement}, you enjoy the company of only London's finest crust. This is the cream of the crop, the gilded, the extravagent. Yes, anyone who is anyone had to be here...and because of that, it had to be even more exclusive. You recieved multiple requests for reservations from the most esteemed of clubs, and even a most elegant letter from the Shuttered Palace.
In one corner sits the Clay Tailor, looking most dapper, in another corner, the Mr. Slowcakes Amensius!
And in the back, in the most private and solitary room you can find, is a single chair(enlarged and shaped specifically to size) reserved for Mr. Pages.
}
{coffee_advertisement == "An Ad in a Doubt Street Publication":
{coffee_advertisement}, you partake of the company of the common man of London! It is an open party, let it be known that you turn away no man. Constables dine with Rubbery Men, Bohemians discuss the arts with the colleges of the University, the Benthic and Summersets argue scholarship with the Bohemians (you can't rightfully tell if anyone is actually listening to each other).
This is the beating heart of London.
}
{coffee_advertisement == "Rumours Spread By Urchins, some of which might be true":
{coffee_advertisement}, you had a ripe showing of the more nefarious elements of London's society. This is a crowd that a more respectable or socially conscious sort of person would be careful to avoid. But because of this, the people are true to their core. Zailors pile in after a hard days work on the Docks, the Duchess arrives in a most inauspicious carriage, and even the Topsy King makes an appearance! Best to keep them apart; criminal empires and all that.

- You have procured the finest ingredients. Guests will be served a hot piping beverage of Coffee. Made from <>

{coffee_beans == "A Premium Bag of Dark Drop Coffee Beans":
{coffee_beans}. This is only the finest selection of ground coffee beans you could muster. You partook of every step of the preparation process. You conscripted the help of some university fellows to design an apparatus to extract only the most delectable fluids from the beans, and infused with such spices and flavours that the drink itself will be held in the same esteem as Year of the Turtle.
}
{coffee_beans == "A Bag of Lower-Quality Dark Drop Coffee Beans, Immorally Acquired":
{coffee_beans}. There are practices out in Station VIII that enable the scientifically-minded to extract the essence of an object. It isn't so much about the coffee flavour that you are going for, rather, for the extraction of the emotions.
From these beans you extract "Weariness of the World"; a potent brew, one who drinks it is engrossed in 'Weltschmerz'.
For the non-Germans in the audience, you explain how the drink imbues the psychological pain caused by sadness that can occur when realizing that someone's own weaknesses are caused by the inappropriateness and cruelty of the world and (physical and social) circumstances.
The effect is temporary, a wave of sadness and misery that overflows on the drinker. But when they finally clear it from their body, they will feel a sense of euphoria as they find new joys in their life.
}
{coffee_beans == "What Appears to be Coffee Beans which assuredly did not come out of a Rat":
{coffee_beans}. Cruel. Terribly cruel. Perhaps you did this to spite a certain individual, perhaps you just like to watch the world burn. The smell is ghastly, and flows over the members of your event. About half of those who attend will never get the smell out of their clothing (which, from a certain point of view is quite charitable, as they end up donating it to the local Orphanage), the other half will get the smell out(but opt not to wear that overcoat quite as frequently).
