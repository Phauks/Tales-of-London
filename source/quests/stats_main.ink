This place is the lifeblood of London. Shipments come from across the Zee, or from the Surface and are exported out of these here docks.
One day, with considerable wealth and influence, perhaps you could have a ship of your own, and take to the high seas. Or, at least, pay someone to steer the ship for you.
It's a rough and tough neighborhood, but with time, you learn the slang and signs and passcodes. Although you don't look the part of a zailor quite yet, you are recognized as a more familiar, and friendly face.

Well, it appears that this place is called a Labyrinth for good reason. You are most assuredly, absolutely, positively lost.
You were fine on the second coil, enjoying a most enjoyable tiger show; then upon leaving you must have taken a wrong turn.
You've been up and down these corridors beyond count. You met a most strange Vicar; and some other hooded fellows. But it seemed in your best interest to avoid those individuals of a cultish nature. Some fellow was breeding monstrosities together; and you had to hide when a most royal procession of cats ventured even deeper would dare to go in your darkest dreams.
You take a breath, and head in the opposite direction of that promenading party. You would prefer not to stay down here longer than necessary; and you will be writing a most unfavorable review in the next morning edition of the post - assuming you make it out, and don't mind earning the ire of some individuals with potentially sharp claws.
There are footsteps coming, and many more paths that must be taken.
But you will make it out...you feel that with unbridled confidence.

Life is something precious, especially more so when it is finite. Yet in this brave new world we find ourselves in, death is but the passing of breath for a brief moment. A blink the face of eternity. Sure, there exists methods via which one can gain immortality, or a pale imitation of it at least. But for those that lack the luxury of that golden path, that escape from the promise of death is but a pale dream.
What is lost with each death? Does some part stay here, with the Boatman? Does some part of you move on? Do all those who perish find themselves on this river? The Rubbery Men and Rats as well?
Where do the Masters find themselves when they die?

BAM! POP! WIZZ!
Fists are flying, as are broken bottles of gin, spittle, and shards of wood.
Ohh! There goes a chair as well. A dock worker known as the Ferocious Fisticuff is in top form today.
While the Black Ribbon might be a more exclusive club, this is for sure the exciting fight club.

You fell in Parabola once, and it came. The Storm-bird. Great. Terrible. The Parabolan incarnation of some great being in the Is.
Now, you shall be the hunter. The Storm-bird is quick, and yet you are relentless.
The Storm-bird is strong, but you shall fight harder.
It will be a terrible battle, spanning the Mirror Marshes and Forests, over the Writhing River and to the unnamed places.
And when you finally gaze into the eyes of this great beast, it will know that you are not its equal, but something far greater.
And beyond, in the Is, terrible beings will begin to unconsciously fear you. For they know that you are a Nightmare they could never escape.

The Zee has always been a treacherous place, even more so when pirates and privateers take to the high seas in search of bounty and loot.
But why should these villains make all the profit.
Whether for honor or glory, in search of profit or justice; you arm you ship with the finest armaments.
Your exploits will become memorable, there will be those who fear your name in hushed conversations; and others who will laugh your actions as a great justice.

War. War never changes. It is a cruel and hungry beast. A unsatiable void which will never be filled.
These wastes were once a battleground. Fierce battles were fought by Men and Devils. What little truth remains of the Campaign against Hell have been destroyed by the very nature of this place.
But through this destruction, you will learn. How the Laws of Devils bent these lands to their will. How Men fought in squads, in legions, in droves.
These lessons come at a terribly price. Or rather, came at a terrible price. The only remnant of the payment being the empty-eyed skulls and crunching of bones beneath your boots.

The Hurlers are a dark and cold place. More so when your Stove runs off on you into the wilderness! Perhaps it was one too many correspondence plaques. Now, you could let things be, and simply build a new one; but you aren't one for half measures.
You track your Stove to the top of a hill. The smoke twiddling out of its 'mouth' made it easy enough to find.
It is skittish, but after two hours of cat and mouse, you finally corner it.
It is scared. And why shouldn't it be? It is a babe in the woods. A newborn child, looking upon this world with new eyes. And you were there, trying to force it to eat when it wasn't hungry!
Being fierce, being dangerous, being determined; these are all aspects of being dangerous. But strength without kindness, is just brute force.
You befriend the stove, as best that you can. You offer guidance and teach it a few skills to help it on its quest.
You hope that it will find peace, after all you have seen you are not sure if you will find some yourself.
You send it on your way, and you go your own.
The last you see of your Stove, he is galumphing into the darkness, and it makes you smile.

Life is very rarely played on an equal playing field. Some have more wealth than others. Others have better manners. Some have connections to the higher ups; others have connections to those who trod in the forgotten depths of society.
The way to win the game, however, is to convince everyone that you have connections to that exact person they wish to meet, or in other cases, the ones they want to avoid.

If you are going to be spending much time here in London, you are definitely going to need a larger wardrobe. Fashion is one of the most paramount aspects of being a proper citizen of the Neath. The most outrageous hats, the most intelligent looking jackets, and cats - cats up and down every aspect of your clothing.
You attend some dinner parties and luncheons to learn the latest trends. You note several gaps where you can start your own.

British Diplomacy is often viewed as a very posh institution; but truly it runs on buttered scones with jelly and an inordinate amount of tea. Only the most well educated, refined, and important individuals have a right to shape this nation. It's a damn shame that the majority of your peers here do not meet those qualifications.
Voices sound with opinions, other voice against. The most important issues are shelved, while the very important issue about whether the uniform of the royal guard should be crimson or violant takes up the majority of the discussions within the Palace.
It isn't terribly exciting, but you do pocket a few political favors for the future.

The Tomb Colonies. Home to the exiles of London and the previous Fallen Cities. There are cults here, and whole political and governmental institutions. The population of this Necropolis far exceeds the population of London; but it gets quite tedious to do a census when you must account for both the living and the dead. Those who live here know terrible secrets; or at least they were of great importance when they could still be considered the living.
Collecting, exchanging, and bartering for information takes a good deal of time and effort. You learn about the secret Cheese wars of the Third City; and the impact the import of Hellworm Milk had on the market. You learn about the rise and fall of Zee Trading Empires; lost to the wrath of Storm's Fury.
It takes many nights to find anything that could be useful for your own plans and schemes; but in that time, you learn to better comport yourself, present yourself, and entertain others. If nothing else, you've gotten far better at extracting that which others may try to hide.

You find yourself at the Foreign Office this day as a disgruntled file clerk. Papers, permits, letters. This is almost as bad as the post office. Visas, identifying documents, records. The reason it is so easy to fake an identity here in the Neath is that there aren't enough workers to keep up with demands.
But, the job has its perks. Although individuals do not reveal all their most terrible secrets to you, they do provide an uncompromising amount of information about their own personal lives. That isn't to say that you would ever use this information against them...you have no need.

With much effort you can convince one of the port-handlers to help you gain access to the Security Booth. It was a terrible mistake, you see; you just 'happened' to forget your case files and key inside the booth. The handler either believes in your acting, or deals with enough irresponsible individuals, that he helps you gain access. You grab the important documents, and head on your way. Tipping the poor fellow on the way out.
The documents are of a mixed variety. Some pertain to shipping imports and exports, others, to ownership and transfers of wealth. What matters to you on these pages, are the entities involved.

Life is a Tragedy, and we are the players. Life is a laugh, a show, a foolish endeavor where one acts until their strings are cut.
Religion offers a respite from this. But religion also had quite the rude awakening when Londoners entered a world most definitely not described in the holy tomes. And the appearance of Devils didn't help with that either.
With that in mind, perhaps a new religious order is necessary. One built upon the new truths of this world. One built to better the world as higher powers intended...or your interpretation of them at least.

You will enter Hell. You will speak with the makers of Law-Furnaces. You will accept a Flower upon your palm.
The place will be a hive of activity, a cacophony of buzzing and dancing Devils.

You've cased the house for three nights; and have a precise time-table of when the servants will take their break. You've acquired a most inconspicuous outfit of a chimney-sweep; and no one gives you a second glance as you scramble across the rooftops.
You noiselessly open the window of the third floor and slink inside the Matrons bedroom.
There are jewels and jewelry on her vanity stand, and the odd piece of gold or two in the cupboard; but what truly interests you is within her safe.
With precision you open the tumblers one after the other, until a satisfying clink sounds your success.
Within the safe you find a well-worn tintype, picturing the Matron when she was a much younger lass, and a young man, dressed in what appears to be Zailor garbs.
Underneath the tintype is a letter, but you will let the Matron have her privacy. You take three of the smaller sacks from within the safe; one filled with First City Coins, another with Fourth City Echoes, and the final one filled with just seven Justificante Coins.

Smoke and Mirrors. Magic and Theatrical Productions have a lot alike in that regard; they both rely upon the presentation of certain facts to the audience to illustrate the illusion. It is an accurate statement; but it would be more apt to call it Snakes and Mirrors.
There exists a world beyond the glass; the Shroud manipulate it for their performances. Men seemingly teleport from one end of the room to the other. Secrets, unspoken, and revealed to the crowd. Bunnies are dropped into a most large top hat. The top hat is proven to be entirely empty. And then the bunny is pulled from the hat once more(albeit is with slightly more sinister eyes).

Although you would think a prison would be a hive of scum and villainy; the operations within are quite orderly - or so the Faithless Rake informs you - and that is because a hierarchy exists. Don't mess with the wrong guy, and you'll survive. Don't rat anyone out, or face the consequences. It makes the stays, temporary or otherwise, much more enjoyable.
You spend your time in New Newgate slowly and silently working off your sentence. It can be terribly boring at times; so, what else can you do but discuss what your life was like outside of the prison. People are so willing to talk about themselves; implicating themselves in crimes committed, or trading trade secrets on how to commit crimes.

It really is quite simple.
First, collect bones. Maybe you find them on some far away Zee Island or washed ashore on the banks of the shore. Some vendors at the Bone Market are selling femurs and spines. Perhaps you will find some method to enlarge the skeletons of small bats.
Second, build a monstrosity. Perhaps you recreate a real beast, or perhaps you use your imagination. How implausible your skeleton may seem to be, it hardly matters. You only need to convince one person, the buyer, in the validity of your wares. Let it have fifty arms and twenty wings. Let it have seven skulls and a terrible tail.

Surrounded by temples and a vast wilderness. These lands are lost, and untamed. This place is not anywhere you recognize, nor is it in the Neath.
You find yourself in the fringes of Parabola. A realm of shadows and mirrors, dreams, and nightmares.

It may take some time to regain your sanity; you may walk the trails of the forgotten cities; or find a dusty trail leading to the Manager of the Royal Bethlehem Inn; but you will recover.
Is that a toolbox you see on the floor?

Bullbone Island is a treasure trove of wealth, if what one is searching for is sand, sand, or more sand. There is little here but a few scrubs and stratified layers of geology. But between those layers, one might find the skulls and skeletons of once great beasts.
Take your shovel and axe and dig; and perhaps you will find secrets hidden in time.

This is a secret place. Beyond the reach of even those who know where it is. There are many powers in the Neath that would pay incredible prices for such information.
You enter the cave, irrigo light illuminating your face.
You will see forgotten things within the crevice. You will meet those who have fled. You will go deeper and deeper, into the violet charged air at the heart of this place. You will enter that heart of hearts, and a voice will call out to you.
...
You leave the Cave of Nadir. You will not forget what you have seen. You haven't forgotten what you have seen? Did you leave something within?
You have much to think about, perhaps you shall return in a weeks time.

What kind of steel is necessary for railroad tracks that will lead to Hell? They must be able to stand unbearable heats, and unfathomable colds. They must be able to pass through the Is to the Is-Not. They must stand under pressure, even as Hellworms migrate over them.
Discovering the formula for such a monumental invention takes much time and energy. When you finally perfect the recipe, you use a careful application of Irrigo on all those involved so they cannot reveal what you have learnt.
Railway Steel will be a useful tool as you expand East. By controlling the supply of this instrumental good, you cement yourself as a powerful player in the upcoming conflicts and riches of the Hinterland.

When the Powers of Parabola fight, they do it in across many leagues and valleys. Through the different realms of this strange land. You fight for many causes: honor, glory, duty, profit. You visit many lands and slay many foes.
There was even that one time you had to face yourself!
These battles temper your mind and body like a forge, and you are all the sharper for it.

You always wanted to be a Barrister. Or well, that's what many people aspire to be. You protect the downtrodden or squish them beneath your feet. The Law is immovable, and just as the Sun rises and its light shines upon the world, so to, will the Law be served.

It will take many years for the city to cool from its formation.
When we grow up, we try to grow our Heart to be big enough to hold everything we hold dear. In this case, someone took it a little too literally.
You witness the birth of a new city. You witness the birth of a new power in the West.
What the Tracklayers have built here is something many dream of and few acquire...a home, safe, warm, and their own.
You will commune with the Heart of the City. It will gaze upon you fondly and offer its aid.
From the harsh Hinterlands, something new, something beautiful.
