A Tale of Christmas Past

- Nestled in the shadowed embrace of Veilgarden, there exists a quaint sanctuary for weary souls seeking respite from the enigmatic streets above. The Cracked Kettle.
As you push open the creaking door, the ambient hum of whispered conversations and the occasional clink of teacups create a melodic backdrop. The interior, draped in rich, velvety curtains that seem to absorb the echoes of secrets shared, is adorned with mismatched vintage furniture salvaged from forgotten corners of the Neath.
Stained glass windows filter the feeble into kaleidoscopic patterns, casting an otherworldly glow upon the patrons huddled in intimate corners. This is a place of secrets and spycraft, and it is rare for a patron of this particular haunt to not be involved in the Great Game.
    + You are here to meet a contact.
    + You are here to collect information.
    + You aren't quite sure what this "Game" is...but you do enjoy a good round of Cricket.
    + They have the best blueberry scones here.
- As you sit down with you fixings, the shouting of an Urchin ring louder and louder until you view him from out the front window of the cafe.
    + You recognize the Urchin. He pickpocketed you when you first arrived!
    + You recognize the Urchin. You have hired his illicit services before.
    + He seems the trust-worthy sort!
- The Bucktoothed Urchin enters the cafe. Sporting a tattered coat that once boasted a vibrant color, now faded to a muted semblance of its former glory, the Urchin's wide, mischievous eyes dart around like quicksilver, always on the lookout for an opportunity or an escape route. Bucktoothed and quick-witted, this pint-sized pickpocket possesses an uncanny ability to slip through the cracks of society, his grin revealing a missing front toothâ€”a testament to both the hardships and the triumphs of a childhood spent dancing on the fringes of the city's shadows.
"Extra! Extra! Fresh from the presses of Doubt Street! Robbery! Vandalism Theivery in the City of Love!
Heads turn. News is never truly new, especially for those in the know. But news from the surface is valuable, for nostaligic purposes, or strategic ones.
The Buck-Toothed Urchin approaches you
"Just one Echo! Special Pricing!" This paper usually sells for a half Echo.
    + Pay the asking price
    + Try to pay the normal price
    + Politely decline
    + Ignore the Urchin
- You take your paper and the Buck-Toothed Urchin moves along. His prices vary wildly from person to person, but patrons are lining up to pay. You read your paper.

Title: "Seine Museum Caper of the Century"
"National Embarassment for the Seine Museum. Museum Curators went to open the museum yesterday morning only to find several rooms the Archaeological Wing had been raided. A variety of Greek, Roman, and Egyptian artifacts were severely damaged or are now missing. Investigators are stumped. But civil government assures they are putting their best agents on the case".
    + You put down the paper.
- The cafe is abuzz. Patrons pay for their beverages without counting, or not at all. Players of Chess and checkers grab their belongings and leave their games in perpetual stalemates.
Even the cafe owner, behind the coffee bar, has turned as white as a sheet.
The cafe has turned chaotic as patrons scramble out.
You don't understand what is going on! But the whirlwind of activity turns and turns and turns you away until you find yourself outside in a pile of snow outside The Cracked Kettle.
    + Pause and breathe.
-   Obviously, something of great importance was just revealed. Or rather, something of imminent danger. Maybe the passerbyers are unaware of the hubbub on the Surface; or maybe they don't understand the importance.
You've got to find someone to explain this nonsense!
    + Seek the Grizzled Veteran for aid.
-   Usually you would find him playing dice on the Docks, or coaching the occasional Londoner who has lost their way.
Instead, you find him in nursing a drink outside the Medusa's Head.
    + Sit down next to him.
-   You take off your overcoat and place it on the snow next to him. You sit down. He distantly glances over at you, then gazes back upon the city.
    + Sit in silence.
    + Ask him if he is doing alright.
- He offers you his flask
    + Take a sip.
    + Politely decline.
- He begins to speak, "It doesn't get easier, you know, or well, you couldn't."
"On the Surface, Death was simple. One was dead or one wasn't. Death was a singular event. Sure there was disease, or war, or famine that could take out whole swaths of people at once; but you could only die once."
"Then you end up down here, and suddenly Death loses all logic and meaning. I've died more times than I can count. I've sat with the Boatman, the conversationalist that he is, and stared across the waters to the Far Shore. I've seen what comes next, and I've made damn well sure that I've stayed away."
"At least before, we could have faith that there was something good after our lives ended. Maybe we knew it was false hope, but we believed it anyways."
    + Philosophical debates about the nature of Death aren't new, but what brings this up now?
- "Too many coincidences are piling up; and I've seen enough Cities to know what comes next. Those before fled to the land of dreams, others had fled across the Zee. Where will these folks go? Wherever it is, there won't be enough room for everyone."
    +   What coincidences?
    The Grizzled Veterans hand grazes the snow, almost like he is soothing the ground.
    "The beasts beneath the city stir, but that's nothing special. After the first few years you learn to live with the fact you live on a powder keg.
-    "It's time to leave. And I don't mean leave this street, or this quarter. It's time to leave London. If you wish to see another day that is. The Masters all have their particular interests and plans; however, there is a peculiar fascination that the Masters share - an insatiable curiosity for the events unfolding that distant City of Love."
